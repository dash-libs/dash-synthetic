# Contributing to dash-synthetic

Thanks for considering a contribution. This is a small, focused library — keep
changes scoped and avoid adding dependencies unless they're essential.

## Development setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dash-libs/dash-synthetic.git
cd dash-synthetic
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Running tests

```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```

Tests must run without a Spark session or a live Databricks workspace — keep
any Spark/Databricks-specific code inside functions (never at module level).
`relationships.py`'s `RelationshipGraph` (table/PK/FK/master-data config,
generation ordering) is pure Python and fully unit-tested without Spark;
`engine.py` and `multi_engine.py` are where Spark/Delta logic lives.

## Linting

```bash
ruff check dashsynthetic/
```

CI runs lint → test (Python 3.9–3.12) → build on every PR; all three must pass.

## Making a change

1. Open an issue first for anything beyond a small fix, so we can agree on
   the approach before you write code.
2. Add or update tests for any behavior change.
3. Keep `CLAUDE.md` in sync if you change the module structure or a design
   rule documented there.
4. Open a PR against `main`. The release workflow handles versioning —
   don't bump the version yourself.

## Reporting bugs / requesting features

Use the issue templates in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`. For security issues,
see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) instead of opening a public issue.
